Hi! I'm Ronny RodrÃ­guez, a junior software developer eager to grow in the tech world. I have hands-on experience building both desktop and web applications.

I'm comfortable working with SQL databases, designing and managing data efficiently to support my projects.

Currently, I'm focused on deepening my understanding of software architecture, secure coding practices, and web development frameworks like **ASP.NET Core**.

I am passionate about writing clean, maintainable code and constantly improving my skills by learning new technologies and best practices.

Looking forward to collaborating on exciting projects and contributing fresh ideas!
